# bootstraping ngx-admin-lte

Bootstraping of Angular4 with AdminLTE dashboard template
( Using ngx-admin-lte Library)


## UPDATE !

This version use the new npm package ngx-admin-lte (this will be easier to update)
If your are looking for the old version for angular check the "angular2" branch.

There's now two different repo:
* [bootstraping-ngx-admin-lte](https://github.com/TwanoO67/bootstraping-ngx-admin-lte) For those who want the full bootstraping
* [ngx-admin-lte](https://github.com/TwanoO67/ngx-admin-lte) For whom want to install via npm in a existing project
